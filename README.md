This is a Greek/Hebrew language syntax search tool designed to be used similar to Accordance, Bible Works, or other major Bible software. It is open-sourced under the MIT license.

This version supports importing of parsed Greek and Hebrew texts from Unbound Bible's unicode format. Support for other formats is in the works.
