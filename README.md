# Rhema

Rhema is a .NET based Greek/Hebrew language syntax search tool designed to be used similar to Accordance, Bible Works, or other major Bible software. It is open-sourced under the MIT license.

This version supports importing of parsed Greek and Hebrew texts from [Unbound Bible's unicode format] (http://unbound.biola.edu/index.cfm?method=downloads.showDownloadMain "Unbound Bible's unicode format"). Support for other formats is in the roadmap.
